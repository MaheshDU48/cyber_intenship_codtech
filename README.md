 Objective:
The goal was to create a simple tool to monitor file changes and ensure data integrity by comparing file hash values over time.

Requirements:
1.Detect any unauthorized or unexpected modifications in files.
2.Use a reliable and secure method (SHA-256 hashing).
3.Allow saving and comparing file states easily.
4.Build a lightweight, beginner-friendly script for students or basic projects.

Tools & Libraries Used:
1.Python: Chosen for its simplicity and readability.
2.hashlib: To generate secure SHA-256 hashes of files.
3.os: To traverse directories and access files.
4.json: To store and read hash values in a structured format.

Outcome:
A Python script was developed with two main features:
1.Save Hashes – Generate and store hash values of files.
2.Check Integrity – Compare current file hashes with saved values to detect changes, deletions, or tampering.
This tool is useful for students learning about cybersecurity basics, file handling, or system monitoring.
